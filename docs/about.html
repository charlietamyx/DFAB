                      I live at Macritchie Reservoir … got a lot of mosquitos.
                      I am currently a Year 2 studying Experience and Communication Design.</p></td>

                <p>As an artist and a designer I chose this module because I felt that this would challenge me
                  to integrate science and art. When I googled “digital fabrication”, I saw a project by Neri Oxman pop up
                  and as a fan of her I became interest in this module.</p>

                  <p>As someone who hopes to be an artist, I feel that by learning a new medium it would expand my knowledge and
                    the art that I can create in the future.</p>

                    <p>I hope to learn by the end of this module how to efficiently work fusion 360 and
                      be fully independent in creating 3D prototypes. My goal would be to use what I have learnt from
                      this module and be able to embark on my own projects to create things out of nothing.
                      It would be pretty cool too if I was able to create art out of this.</p>
